If you didn’t see yet the short video  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5NptOcD3gg
I give you a little overview what #REDEX is and what it does for you.

REDEX is a complete new business model to build fortune and prosperity. A closed system for the members, meaning there is no commission or profit for the owners paid. The owners make their money like the members.

The currency oft he program is Bitcoin (BTC). Through paying small amounts into the system and a calculated redistribution-system, it is possible to fill 7 fields. Each field which gets filled, a payment occurs immedeately. The decision is made by everybody himself, wether they invest the half oft he received money into the next field or be satisfied with the lower profit. The 7th field has a payout of 1.800 Bitcoin, over a Million USD based on todays rate. But also the payouts of the previous fields are significant.

Earning Millions with REDEX is not an empty phrase. The concept is ingenious and it is really possible to make Millions with REDEX. With a rediculous small investment.

This aim is possible for every person, only the promptness is depending from everyones individual efforts.

                                                                     ====== 1 ======

In the following is every step explaned how to open 7 REDEX accounts.

Please, after you registered and clicked your Activation Link in your confiramation Email, login to your REDEX account and you get to the Dashboard in your Backoffice.
At first click to choose your lenguage and get back to the Dashboard.

                                                                     ====== 2 ======

Next step is to open your RDX Wallet.

On the upper site you see 4 fields: RED BLUE GREEN and BLACK
Click the blue field  #RDXCOIN
A white field is opening and showes your RDXnumber
This RDXnumber ist your Wallet login ID and the Wallet ID to transfer Bitcoins within the REDEX system.
Copy this number and click Open wallet
Next page click on top right of center  WALLET   (please not on CREATE  AN ACCOUNT, it’s created already)
Next page login with your Wallet RDXnumber and password.
(same Passwort for REDEX and Wallet accounts)

REDEX just installed an additional Security facility. Unfortunately they don’t have updated the lenguage on this page yet. What it means when you entered the Username and Password, they sent you a code to your email account. Just check your email for the code, copy and past it into the line and enter.

                                                                   ====== 3 ======

When you already have your Bitcoin Wallet installed and funded with 0.035 Bitcoin, you can send this amount to your REDEX Wallet.

                                                                   ====== 4 ======

To get your REDEX Bitcoin address, go to your REDEX Dashboard and click the green bar and copy your Bitcoin address
Go to your Bitcoin Wallet and send 0.035 (or according to the numbers of accounts you are going to open) to this address of yout REDEX Wallet.

Mostly the REDEX account is funded in a few minutes but sometime it takes a little bit longer.
You have now the money for 7 accounts in your first REDEX Wallet.

                                                                  ====== 5 ======

Now you go back to your REDEX accout.
Close the white field and look at your Dashboard.
When the money arrived in your Wallet, you can see it also on the Dashboard in the green field above.

                                                                 ====== 6 ======

Here you are goint to open your first Field (Partner) which is green.
Click on the blue button Go to. Then on the next page click on the blue field in the right upper area to join.

You are done. Go back to Dashboard.

Now, after you opened your first field you can see in the right upper area appeared a white field with your Referral Link in it. Copy this Link and paste it somewhere, e.g. into a Texfile *

Fore every 6 accounts you are going to open now you will use your Referral Link.

                                                                ====== 7 ======

*Textfile. I do recommand to open a textfile and copy all email addresses, usernams, RDXnumbers and the Password ( for all accounts) into this Textfile and keep it safe.

                                                                ====== 8 ======

Remember please, each time you open a new account, first logout  and close both sites, the #REDEX and the Wallet sites.

When you are going to open more then one account, you must use different usernames for each account and a separat Email address aswell.

Do simple add a number to the username

username
username2
username3
and so on

Passwort take for all accounts the same.

                                                                    ===== 9 ======

** Just in case you don’t know, Gmail offers to use Subemail accounts by making dots between the letters. All emails from all Accounts you are receiving in your Main account.
If you have already a Gmail account with at least 7 letters you can use it. If you don't have one, you can quickly open a new one.
​E.g. you create a email address with the name: oldfirehand@gmail.com

​Then you create Subemail accounts with a dot between the letters as following:
o.ldfirehand@gmail.com          for your next account
ol.dfirehand@gmail.com         and so on
old.firehand@gmail.com          
oldf.irehand@gmail.com         
oldfi.rehand@gmail.com         
oldfir.ehand@gmail.com         

You can create as many accounts as you have letters ahead of @ and all emails you receive to a Subemail address come into your main account.
